Annoying window (tests in rust)

The program show a picture (the "im" file) in a window and move it, if the window is closed by the Task Manager, the program will open a new window and continue to move the picture.
To really close the program, you need to do Ctrl+Shift+F7 when the window is active (you can still close the progrm with the Task Manager if closed the "handler.exe" process before).
